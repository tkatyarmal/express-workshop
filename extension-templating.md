# Individual Blog Posts - extension

Add a page for each blog post using express's [URL parameters](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html#route-parameters) and [template engines](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-template-engines.html).

## Step 1 - URL parameters

We don't want to have to write a handler for each URL in our application. Express's [URL parameters](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html#route-parameters) let us specify dynamic sections of the a URL - a space for a blog post ID or username, for example. You can think of them as function arguments being passed to your server.

Express's URL parameters use a `:` for dynamic parts of the URL:

- `/users/:userId` - matches URLs like `/users/123`, `/users/node-girls`
- `/users/:userId/posts/:postId` - matches URLs like `/users/node-girls/posts/node-is-best`

Let's add a handler for serving individual blog posts:

```js
app.get('/posts/:postId', function (req, res) {
    res.send('post id: ' + req.params.postId);
});
```

What do you think you'll see when you visit http://localhost:3000/posts/abc123 in your browser?

## Step 2 - Reading from the file and sending the specific blog post

Just like with
[`/create-post`](https://github.com/node-girls/express-workshop/blob/master/step08.md#reading-from-your-hard-drive),
you need to read your JSON file. Try and send the post content back to the browser:
`res.send(postContentHere)`

## Step 3 - rendering a template

Right now we're just sending the plain text of your blog post, but you probably want to jazz up
your post with some HTML and CSS. For this, we can use Express's built in templating system. You
can use any template language you want (like [pug/jade](https://pugjs.org/),
[ejs](http://www.embeddedjs.com/), or [handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/)), but we're going to
use [mustache](https://mustache.github.io/) (which is very similar to handlebars) in this example.

Run `npm install --save mustache-express`, then check the documentation for
[mustache-express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mustache-express) and
[Express's templating](http://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-template-engines.html). You'll need to
create a template file in `views/post.mustache` like this:

```mustache
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Blog Post</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>yay blog post!</h1>
    <article>
      {{ post }}
    </article>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Even More Stretch Goals:
- Give your posts titles
- Add a post listing page
- Render posts as Markdown
- Yay!
